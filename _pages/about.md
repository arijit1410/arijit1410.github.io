I am primarily interested in AI and its applications to various domains such as Natural Language Processing, Advanced Information Retrieval, etc. Currenly, I'm a Masters in Computer Science Student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong publication record, having published at ACL, NAACL, COLING and INTERSPEECH as an undergraduate. Additionally, I've worked as a Data Scientist at UnitedHealth Group, where I have conceptualized, prototyped, and deployed large ML models at scale, having built concurrent and robust systems that process millions of data points and monitor them. I've also dabbled in AI Robotics and set up Data Science practices for an early stage startup.

In 2020, I was inducted into the Heidelberg Laureate Forum as a Young Researcher, selected as one of the top 200 student researchers in Computer Science and Mathematics, all across the world.
