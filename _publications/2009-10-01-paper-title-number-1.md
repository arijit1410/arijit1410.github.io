collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The availability of large-scale online social data, coupled with computational methods can help us answer fundamental questions relat-ing to our social lives, particularly our health and well-being. The# MeToo trend has led to people talking about personal experiences of harassment more openly. This work at-tempts to aggregate such experiences of sex-ual abuse to facilitate a better understanding of social media constructs and to bring about social change. It has been found that disclo-sure of abuse has positive psychological im-pacts. Hence, we contend that such informa-tion can leveraged to create better campaigns for social change by analyzing how users react to these stories and to obtain a better insight into the consequences of sexual abuse. We use a three part Twitter-Specific Social Media Lan-guage Model to segregate personal recollec-tions of sexual harassment from Twitter posts. An extensive comparison with state-of-the-art generic and specific models along with a de-tailed error analysis explores the merit of our proposed model.'
